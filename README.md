# GDExtensionTemplate

This project is a template meant as a starting point for creating new C++/CMake-based Godot 4 extensions. It is currently set up to work with Godot 4.0 beta 7.

Since the majority of C++ open source projects use CMake, I wanted to offer an alternative to the scons system for building Godot extensions (if you use scons, check out Nathan Franke's [gdextension](https://github.com/nathanfranke/gdextension) template).

There are a lot of little things to get right when starting a project like this, so this template covers the following:

- includes [godot-cpp](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) as a submodule
- links `godot-cpp` statically to your shared lib
- creates a `<project>.gdextension` file
- installs the files with the correct structure to a given location (`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`)
- uses [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) (if available) for faster rebuilds
- provides a cmake target (`clang-format`) for running `clang-format` on all the sources at once

To use this for your own project:

- copy this repository
- rename of the directory to the name of your extension
- change `GDExtensionTemplate` in the `project` macro in CMakeLists.txt to the name of your extension
- replace the example code in `src` with your own
- replace this `README.md` with your own
- remove/replace `.github/FUNDING.yml`

Optional:

- [contribute to the project](#how-to-contribute) (not just üí∞!)
- edit `templates/template.gdextension.in` to add/remove supported platform/architectures
- change `.clang-format` to fit your style
- change the LICENSE
